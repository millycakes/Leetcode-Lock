# Leetcode Lock
Do you sometimes find yourself getting sidetracked by Netflix when you know you should be grinding out Leetcode? Then this chrome extension was designed for you! Leetcode Lock allows you to enter in websites you want to blacklist, and on access, it will redirect you to a random Leetcode question based on topics you can choose yourself through the extension. After you successfully solve a question you have not previously solved already, Leetcode Lock will successfully be unlocked for the day, and you will be able to freely visit all your blacklisted sites!

## How to Run
Enable Developer Mode in chrome extensions, click load unpacked, and upload the folder Leetcode Lock resides in. 

## How to Use
If you want to focus on certain topics such as dynammic programming or arrays, simply select on your desired tags! To blacklist websites, enter in the domain name of the site you want to blacklist (I.e. instagram.com).
